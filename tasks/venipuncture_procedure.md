## Venipuncture Procedure Analysis

**Description:** This task analyzes a video of a venipuncture (blood draw) procedure. The goal is to identify, in sequence, the exact frame where each critical step of the procedure begins and ends. The analysis should track the state of the procedure as it moves through the three main phases.

**Core Analysis Criteria:**

Log an "Event Start" or "Event Complete" by identifying the following visual evidence in the frames.

### Phase 1: Preparation

* **1. Gather Equipment:**
    * **What to look for:** The 'sterile work area' (e.g., a tray) being populated with objects: 'needle', 'needle holder', 'tourniquet', 'gauze pads', 'alcohol wipes', 'vacuum bottles', and 'bandages'.
* **2. Decontaminate Hands:**
    * **What to look for:** The 'clinician's hands' interacting with a 'sanitizer dispenser' or 'sink' in a washing/rubbing motion.
* **3. Inspect & Position Patient:**
    * **What to look for:** The 'patient's arm' being moved to a 'straight' position on a 'support surface'. The 'clinician's hand' may be touching the arm.
* **4. Apply Tourniquet:**
    * **What to look for:** The 'tourniquet' (object) being wrapped around the 'patient's upper arm' and secured.
* **5. Identify & Palpate Vein:** 
    * **What to look for:** The 'clinician's finger' pressing (palpating) on the 'antecubital fossa' (inner elbow) area.
* **6. Clean Skin:**
    * **What to look for:** An 'alcohol wipe' (object) being moved across the 'puncture site' (a zone on the patient's arm).

### Phase 2: The Procedure

* **7. Insert Needle:**
    * **What to look for:** The 'needle tip' making first contact with the 'puncture site' and then disappearing into the skin.
* **8. Insert Vacuum Bottle:**
    * **What to look for:** A 'vacuum bottle' (object) being pushed into the 'needle holder' (object). A "flash" of blood in the tube may also be visible.
* **9. Release Tourniquet:**
    * **What to look for:** The 'clinician's hand' interacting with the 'tourniquet' *after* blood flow is established, causing it to loosen or fall away.
* **10. Withdraw Needle:**
    * **What to look for:** The 'needle tip' exiting the 'puncture site'.
* **11. Apply Pressure:**
    * **What to look for:** A 'gauze pad' (object) being placed on the 'puncture site' *immediately* as or after the needle is withdrawn.

### Phase 3: Post-Procedure & Safety

* **12. Activate Safety Device:**
    * **What to look for:** The 'clinician's finger' pushing a 'safety sheath' or 'button' on the 'needle' object, causing the needle to be covered or retract.
* **13. Dispose of Needle:**
    * **What to look for:** The 'needle' (or entire 'needle holder' assembly) being dropped into a 'sharps container' (object).
* **14. Apply Dressing:**
    * **What to look for:** A 'bandage' or 'medical tape' being applied over the 'gauze pad' at the 'puncture site'.
* **15. Wash Hands:**
    * **What to look for:** A *second instance* of the 'clinician's hands' interacting with a 'sanitizer dispenser' or 'sink'.
